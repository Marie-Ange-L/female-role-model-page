						<h3 class="green-blob">Mel's Journey</h3>
						<p>
							In addition to her writing and speaking, Mel has made significant
							contributions to television and digital media. She has hosted
							shows on CNN, participated as a&nbsp;legal analyst, and created
							engaging online courses that help individuals transform their
							lives. Her approachable and authentic style, combined with

						<h3 class="yellow-blob">The 5 Second Rule</h3>
						<p>
							The cornerstone of Mel’s philosophy is the 5&nbsp;Second Rule, a
							psychological technique she discovered during a&nbsp;period of
							personal struggle. The rule is simple: when you have an instinct
							to act on a goal, you must physically move within five seconds or
							your brain will kill the idea. This rule leverages the science of
							metacognition, interrupting negative thought patterns and
							encouraging decisive action.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3 class="pink-blob">Empowering Lives</h3>
						<p>
							In
							<i>The Mel Robbins Podcast</i>, Mel explores a&nbsp;wide range of
							topics related to self-improvement, mental health, and personal
							growth. She also actively connects with her audience through
							social media, providing daily doses of motivation and practical
							advice. By openly sharing her own struggles and triumphs, Mel
							becomes a&nbsp;relatable figure, demonstrating that change is
							possible no matter where you start.
